# Instructor Checklist of Objectives

### Exercise #1: Building Better Prompts Objectives

In this section, students will build their own ChatGPT system by creating and setting up a React project with JavaScript, Next.js, and the Vercel SDK.

- Review the Vercel Suite of AI Tools and SDK to build your own ChatGPT
- Create a React Project with JavaScript and Next.js
- Build Prompts for your AI chat bot
- Build Routes
- Use Hooks
- Work with Vercel's SDK Core, React Server Components (RSC), and User Interface (UI).

### Lab #1: Prompt Tuning Objectives

In this section, students will build their own ChatGPT system by creating and setting up a React project with JavaScript, Next.js, and the Vercel SDK.

- Review Vercel AI SDK Core, UI, RSC / Introduction to lab
- Tune prompts
- Try different streaming interface
- Make your AI make a decision based on prompts and data it knows / receives

### Exercise #2: Pretrained Models Objectives

We will walkthrough setting up a music-based project to identify musical notes with a selected pre-trained LLM and it's associated data that takes audio for prompts.

- Review types of prompts.
- Demonstrate process of choosing pre-trained model and datasets to use for app.
- Walkthrough setup of class project (it will be used for labs later!)
- Basic chord detection logic from AI

### Exercise #3: AI in the Real World Objectives

Why do we build applications? A lot of times we will be making decisions or completing a task. Students will continue expanding exercise 2 to advance the AI music app by incorporating a fake Spotify API data to utilize AI to make decisions.

- Advance class project together (this also provides a refresher on how to send requests to ADD fake API to get data from fake Spotify API)
- Use data, logic, prompting, and of course your AI to make an informed decision
